Notifications.js
================

##### Ver 2.0.0

### Planned Differences
There are many differences I am planning to implment in version 2. These are the following:
+ Notifications namespace - To help prevent confliction with other functions I am planning to use a namespace to surround all of the code for Notifications.js
+ Improved customisation - The plan for this is to make so that users can easily add their own types by using the built function for doing this.
+ Class based - When using notifications.js you will use the `new` identifier to specifiy a new notification group. This will allow multiple instances of notifications on the same page.
+ More types - instead of having just the notification that comes in from the side I am planning to implement different styles for different purposes.
+ CSS3 - everything will use CSS3. This means all animations will be CSS3 which means improved performance as they would be hardware accelerated.
+ More - if you have any features you would like to see implemented then please fork the code and add it or post an issue
